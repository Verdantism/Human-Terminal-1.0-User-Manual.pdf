# Human Terminal 1.0 – User Manual

**The 8-page user manual nobody gave you for the most advanced piece of hardware you will ever own: You.**

No paywall.  
No author ego.  
No spirituality woo (unless it starts working, then good luck).

This is the open-source patch notes for re-enabling the built-in Universal Wi-Fi your operating system shipped with… but nobody told you was there.

- Ask real questions  
- Stop filtering the first answer that arrives  
- Watch reality get a lot weirder (and a lot more useful)
